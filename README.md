## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of AWS DevOps concepts, including:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild
- Monitoring and logging with AWS CloudWatch
- Security best practices for AWS resources

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - for infrastructure provisioning
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - to interact with AWS services
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - for containerization (if applicable)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-devops.git
cd aws-devops
```

### Configuration

1. **AWS Credentials**: Ensure your AWS credentials are configured. You can do this using the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Terraform Initialization**: Navigate to the Terraform directory and initialize:

   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Apply Terraform Configuration**: To provision the infrastructure defined in your Terraform scripts:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Terraform Configuration

This repository contains various Terraform configurations for deploying AWS resources. Each directory contains specific configurations related to different services or applications.

### Example Terraform Configuration

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket
}
```

## AWS DevOps Practices

The repository also covers best practices for AWS DevOps, including:

- Implementing CI/CD pipelines using AWS services.
- Monitoring infrastructure and applications with AWS CloudWatch.
- Managing security and access control through IAM roles and policies.
